# zabbix-GPU-temperature
see how to monitor GPU temperature with zabbix on ubuntu.

run this command to make your drivers up-to-date : 

$ sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall ,

$ sudo reboot

then clone this repository.
after that go ahead and uncomment UserParameter=0 and set it to 1 in zabbix_agentd.conf :
$ sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf 

add the content of nvidiaGPUTemp.conf below it.

exit nano editor using CTRL+x;

then open your web browser and go to your zabbix server which in my case is localhost.
(if you don't have zabbix6 installed fallow this tutorial)

from the left modules select Configuration > Templates. on the top-right click on import then on Browse and select Template nvidiaGPUTemp.xml and click on import.

Now in the same module select Hosts then click items on the host you want it to be.

on the top-left click on Create item. then fill out the form and type nvidiaGPUTemp in "KEY" input. Set a NAME, Set "UNITS" to Â°C , "Update interval" to 10s and "Type of information" to Numeric(float), then add.

Eventually, after a few minutes go ahead and check it on Monitoring > Host > yourHost. hit and choose latest data now you can finally see it.
